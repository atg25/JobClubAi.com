## Notes on Persona Usage
- Use these personas to inform content, event programming, mentorship matching, and automation priorities.
- Prioritize onboarding flows and email content that identify and remediate the most common missing assets (LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio site, Calendly).
- Map persona success metrics to CRM fields so progress can be tracked (e.g., `portfolio_published`, `mentor_assigned`, `workshops_attended`).
