# AI Usage Log

This document logs all AI-assisted work, prompts, and outputs for the Job Club project.

## Overview

AI (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude) has been used throughout this project for:

- Code generation and component scaffolding
- TypeScript type definitions and React patterns
- Documentation creation and refinement
- Debugging and problem-solving
- Sanity CMS schema design
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Accessibility improvements
- Content structure and planning

- Implemented TypeScript interfaces and type safety
- Created responsive Tailwind CSS styling
- Optimized with React.lazy() code splitting

### 2. Sanity CMS Integration

- Schema design for eventType, resourceType, memberProfileType
- GROQ query patterns for data fetching
- PortableText component configuration
- Image URL builder implementation

### 3. Performance & Optimization

- Vite configuration for bundle splitting
- Manual chunks for vendor code
- Lazy loading strategy
- Performance monitoring setup

### 4. Documentation

- Sprint planning and task breakdown
- QA checklist comprehensive coverage
- Deployment guide creation
- Requirements tracking

### 5. Accessibility

- ARIA label suggestions
- Keyboard navigation patterns
- Screen reader optimizations
- Color contrast validation

## Notes

All AI-generated code has been reviewed, tested, and adapted to project requirements. AI served as a productivity accelerator, not a replacement for developer judgment and expertise.
